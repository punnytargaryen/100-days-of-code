# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 03, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Tried to create a model for multilabelled classification using different data.

**Thoughts:** I really struggle with Python in general as well as figuring out how functions work and adapting it to my stuff.

### Day 2: March 04, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Tried to create the Submission csv for the model created yesterday.

**Thoughts:** The fact that I'm not very proficient at python is starting to come back to bite me in the ass.

### Day 3: March 05, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Finally succeeded in creating the submission csv.

**Thoughts:** Feels great to finally learn a bit of Pandas and create the submissions file. But hackerearth is looking to be a pretty bad platform to work on to be honest.

### Day 4: March 06, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Tried to understand the google images download script in order to create my own dataset.

**Thoughts:** There's still a lot I have to learn about scripts and other important things.

### Day 5: March 07, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Created an Image classifier in about 30 minutes, didn't have the time to deploy it.

**Thoughts:** I want to understand how I deploy my webapp, so I will be taking my time with it.
